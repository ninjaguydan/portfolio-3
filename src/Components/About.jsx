              I'm a Front End Engineer from Jackson, MS with an extensive background in art and design. Not only do I enjoy building things, but I enjoy making them look good! Skilled in solving problems with semantic HTML, CSS, Typescript, React and Figma with an emphasis on accessibility. I think
              understanding the human experience is essential for creating useful and effective products that make life easier for everyone, and I enjoy using my skill-set to empower people to accomplish their goals. You can check some of the other projects I've built{" "}

              Software devs I meet tend to always have things they're into apart from code, and hearing about those hobbies is one of my favorite parts of meeting other devs! As far me, I love to draw! If you're into that and are interested in seeing more of my artwork, check out my work below. I
              can't wait to connect and hear about your interestsâ€”both professional and personal!
